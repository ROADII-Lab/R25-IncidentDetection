# Project Description

### ROADII Use Case 25 - Traffic Incident Detection through ML methods

- **Title:** Traffic Incident Detection through ML methods
- **Purpose and goals of the project:** This use case aims to create a data collection and modeling process that will forecast crash probability for the next 4-7 days along highways and major roadways at a state-level. These data could be used for operations, management, and traveler information. 
- **Purpose of the source code and how it relates to the overall goals of the project:** This repository contains code and documentation for explorations in the generalization and deployment of techniques for detecting traffic incidents and assessing roadway network vulnerabilities using real-time and historical datasets. Intended audiences are state DOTs and traffic management centers wanting to improve their ability to respond quickly to incidents on their roadways, as well as to better understand how traffic incidents affect the larger roadway network.
- **Length of the project:** This use case is currently in the exploratory phase. The ROADII team has been updating 2019 work with the Tennessee Highway Patrol to forecast crash probability over the next week. The ROADII team has also been conducting stakeholder outreach with FHWA Office of Operations and state DOT Traffic Managment Centers to evaluate interest and feasibility of the use case. The ROADII team will be updating this repository as stable developments are created. This phase will likely continue through summer 2024. 


# Prerequisites

Requires:
- R 4.3.0 or later
- Data on Waze, crashes by roadway, and historical weather 

# Usage
*Provide users with detailed instructions for how to use your software. The specifics of this section will vary between projects, but should adhere to the following minimum outline:*

## Building

## Contents

The [Code](https://github.com/ITSJPO-TRIMS/R25-IncidentDetection/tree/main/Code) folder contains the code and installation instructions of the ROADII-Lab exploration of the traffic incident detection use case. It will be populated with functions, model code, training parameters, and eductional materials to help potential users or stakeholders with the development process for the deployment of their own traffic incident detection system. 


The steps to running the code are as follows:
1.	Download zipped data files and R scripts, preserving the directory structure. Place files into home directory. For Windows users, this is C:\Users\[user]\Documents. If needed, update file paths to locations where data and scripts are saved, although placing files into the home directory should work without any updates.
2.	Run RandomForest_WazeGrids_TN.R
a.	Install packages with install.packages(“[package name]”) as needed
3.	Run PredictWeek_TN.R


## Testing

The development team is currently building testing functions. For now, the recommended testing is examining the results to ensure they line up with general knowledge of roads and upcoming weather trends. 

## Execution


*Explain how to use the final product of your code. If your code is meant to be run as is (ex: scripts), specify how to run those scripts. If your code is meant to be deployed (ex: AWS Lambda), specify how to do that.*

Example:

Run the script:
```
python /scripts/myScript.py
```

Deploy to Lambda:
```
aws lambda create-function --function-name my-function ... 
```

# Additional Notes
*Optional - Any additional information that would be useful to someone wanting to use this code. If there are datasets and associated Data Management Plans that interact with this source code, please provide them here*

The [Demos](https://github.com/ITSJPO-TRIMS/R25-IncidentDetection/tree/main/Demos) folder contains pre-built demonstrations of the results of the analysis, data explorations, visualizations, and performance metrics for the solutions developed for this use case. This will be updated once more work is created with partner organizations. 


## Context on Previous Related Work
This use case builds on 2019 work that the Volpe Center did with Tennessee Highway Patrol under the U.S. DOT [Safety Data Initiative](https://www.transportation.gov/SafetyDataInitiative/Pilots).  The [Tennessee Integrated Traffic Analysis Network](https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/transportation-policy/sdi-waze-project-summary-documents) (TITAN) crash model was built to be used by the Tennessee Highway Patrol (TN HP) to prioritize patrol locations. The model combined historical data such as fatal crashes and DUI arrests with current data including weather forecasts, and scheduled special events to generate heat maps that identifies areas of high likelihood for crashes. The TITAN model estimates crash propensity in 42 square mile grids. This resolution provides the most accurate estimates of fatal crash propensity in four hour time windows over the upcoming week, based on scheduled special events and weather forecasts. The objective of the TN HP and U.S. DOT SDI partnership was to test if Waze alerts can improve the spatial resolution of the TITAN model, particularly in urban areas. TN HP provided training data from the TITAN model, and the Volpe team quantitatively assessed the value that Waze data adds to the existing TITAN model.

**Known Issues:**

None identified. 

**Associated datasets:**

The internal ROADII team has explored a number of datasets that may suport the development of AI models to improve and generalize traffic incident detection systems. Some of these datasets are real-time and crowd sourced while others are historical and based on measurements of traffic characteristics over time.

* Waze Data
The Waze roadway incident and jams data are provided by the Waze for Cities Program (previously known as the Connected Citizens Program). These data are provided free by Waze to public agencies around the world, partly in exchange for participation in provisioning roadway closure data, and partly as a public service by Waze. Waze provides real-time, anonymous, proprietary incident and slow-down information directly from drivers, aggregate these data, and provides them to public agencies. Public agency partners provide real-time and advance information on construction, crash, and road closure data. 

The data are provided nationally across the US to the USDOT through a Memorandum of Understanding with the USDOT Chief Data Officer. The data have been stored in the USDOT Secure Data Commons (SDC) since spring 2017.
The stream of data from the Waze API is in JSON format, with an API call every 2 minutes. The structure of these data and fields are described in the Waze Traffic Data Specification Document, Version 2.7.1 (Waze_Traffic_Data_Spec.pdf). 

In SDC, these data are housed in a Redshift relational database. There are three main tables that are used in data analysis: alerts, jams, and jam point sequences. 

* HSIS Data
The Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) was developed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to address the need for a comprehensive, data-driven approach to highway safety. Highway engineers and administrators need to make informed decisions concerning the design and operation of the highway system, considering factors such as the geometric design of the roadway, the selection and placement of roadside hardware, the use of traffic control measures, the size and performance capabilities of the vehicles, and the needs and abilities of the users. To facilitate these decisions, it's important to have data about crashes, roadway geometrics, traffic control devices, traffic volume, and the location of hardware and obstacles on the roadside. This data needs to be in computerized files and easily linked so that it can be rapidly assembled and prepared for analysis.

The HSIS is a roadway-based system that provides quality data on a large number of accident, roadway, and traffic variables. It uses data already being collected by the States for managing the highway system and studying highway safety. HSIS can be used to analyze a wide range of safety problems, from basic "problem identification" issues to modeling efforts that attempt to predict future crashes from roadway characteristics and traffic factors. It is used in support of the FHWA safety research program and provides input for program policy decisions. HSIS is also available to professionals conducting research under the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, universities, and others studying highway safety.

* OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data
The updated use case will use OSM road segments, rather than grid cells. OSM is nationally available and includes all roads in the U.S. This use case will focus on [OSM's road classification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/United_States/Road_classification) on motorways (generally aligned to the National Highway System), but will eventually include all highway and arterial roads.
