# R25-TrafficIncidentDetectionGeneralization
ROADII Use Case 25 - Traffic Incident Detection through ML methods

This repository contains code and documentation for explorations in the generalization and deployment of
techniques for detecting traffic incidents and assessing roadway network vulnerabilities using 
real-time and historical datasets. Intended audiences are state DOTs and traffic management centers 
wanting to improve incident response rates and understand how traffic incidents affect the larger
roadway network.

## Contents
1. Code

    This folder contains the code and results of the ROADII-Lab exploration of the traffic incident detection use case. It will be populated with functions, model code, training parameters, and eductional materials to help potential users or stakeholders with the development process for the deployment of their own traffic incident detection system. This 


2. Demos folder:

    This folder contains pre-built demonstrations of the results of the analysis, data explorations, visualizations, and perforamance metrics for the solutions developed for this use case.
