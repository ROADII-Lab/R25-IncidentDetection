# 1. Project Description

### ROADII Use Case 25 - Traffic Incident Prediction through ML methods

- **Title:** Traffic Incident Prediction through ML methods
- **Purpose and goals of the project:** This use case aims to create a data collection and modeling process that will forecast crash probability for the next 4-7 days along highways and major roadways at a state-level. These data could be used for operations, management, and traveler information.

The above image was generated using a model generated for Washington State and reflects the crash probability for road segments in the Seattle area on March 6th at 12:00 AM PST.
- **Purpose of the source code and how it relates to the overall goals of the project:** This repository contains code and documentation for explorations in the generalization and deployment of techniques for detecting traffic incidents and assessing roadway network vulnerabilities using real-time and historical datasets. Intended audiences are state DOTs and traffic management centers wanting to improve their ability to respond quickly to incidents on their roadways, as well as to better understand how traffic incidents affect the larger roadway network.
- **Length of the project:** This use case is currently in the exploratory phase. The ROADII team has been updating 2019 work with the Tennessee Highway Patrol to forecast crash probability over the next week. The ROADII team has also been conducting stakeholder outreach with FHWA Office of Operations and state DOT Traffic Managment Centers to evaluate interest and feasibility of the use case. The ROADII team will be updating this repository as stable developments are created. This phase will likely continue through summer 2024. 

 
# 2. Prerequisites

General Requirements:
- Internet Connection
- Tableau Reader (free to download)
- R 4.3.0 or later (free to download)

Requirements for Predictions:
- Historical Waze Alert Data
- Historical Waze Jams Data 
- Weather Forecast

Requirements for Training:
- Historical Crash Data
- Historical Weather Data
- Historical Weather Data

# File Structure

- The primary directory is `R25-IncidentPrediction/Code`. All work should be done from the Incident_Prediction.Rproj R project. 
- The `Analysis` folder contains the primary R scripts used to run the Incident_Prediction tool. 
- The `utility` folder contains scripts used for data cleaning and database querying. Key parameters are passed to these scripts via the scripts in the Analysis folder. 
- The `Input` folder stores all raw data files including HSIS crash data, Open Street Maps road networks, Waze jams and alerts data, and weather data
- The `Intermediate` folder contains data that has undergone some cleaning and manipulation. The datacleaning and preparation process be computationally intensive so this folder provides storage for data that only needs to be cleaned once and then reused. 
- The `Output` folder contains the primary results from the Analysis scripts, including trained Random Forest models, model diagnostics, and predictions.

## Usage

The [Code](https://github.com/ITSJPO-TRIMS/R25-IncidentPrediction/tree/main/Code) folder contains the code and installation instructions of the ROADII-Lab exploration of the traffic incident Prediction use case. It will be populated with functions, model code, training parameters, and eductional materials to help potential users or stakeholders with the development process for the deployment of their own traffic incident Prediction system. 


The steps for training models and generating predictions are as follows:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to a directory of your choice on your machine.
2. Open `Code/IncidentPrediction/Incident_Prediction.Rproj`â€”all scripts must be executed through this `.Rproj` file.

3. Open `Code/master_script.R` 

   This script is where all parameters are set by the user, and the two primary analysis scripts are sourced. Parameters set in this script include:
   
   - `num`: (string) A name for the model being generated.
   - `state`: (string) The state abbreviation for which predictions are being generated.
   - `time_bins`: (boolean) Indicates whether the tool should group data into 6-hour increments.
   - `imputed_waze`: (boolean) Indicates whether Waze data should be imputed for the upcoming week.
   - `projection`: (integer) Defines the geographic projection or coordinate reference system to be used. This is commonly either 5070 (North America) or 4326 (Global) 
   - `test_percentage`: (numeric) Defines the percentage of the observations to be used in the test sample. 
   - `road_types`: (character) Road type or list of road types to query for. Potential types include motorway, trunk, primary, secondary, and tertiary, defined according to OpenStreetMap. For OpenStreetMap definitions, visit [OSM Highway Key](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway).
   
   The user then has the option to source `analysis/RandomForest_Train.R` and `analysis/PredictWeek.R`. 
   
   Random_Forest_Train.R trains a random forest model using historical Waze jams and alerts data, weather data, and roadway configuration data to predict crashes. The initial execution may take over an hour, depending on your machine. Subsequent runs will be faster but may still take more than 30 minutes.
   
   Outputs from RandomForest_Train include:
   - `Model_{model_number}_RandomForest_Output.RData`: The trained random forest model.
   - `AUC_{model_number}.pdf`: A PDF with an Area-Under-Curve graph for the trained model.
   - `{model_number}_RandomForest_pred.csv`: A CSV containing predictions on the test dataset.
   - `Fitvars_{model_number}.csv`: A CSV listing the variables used in model training.
   - `importance_barplot{model_number}_{date}.png`: A bar plot showing the importance of each variable used in the model.
   
   Predict_Week.R  combines the defined roadway network with predicted weather and imputed Waze data then uses a trained random forest model to forecast crash locations for the next seven days. It then generates a Tableau dashboard to visualize the resulting predictions.
   
   Note that Predict_Week requires a model generated from Random_Forest_Train to make predictions. Therefore, the user must run Random_Forest_Train at least once before using Predict_Week.R to generate crash predictions. Once Random_Forest_Train has been executed, and random forest model will be saved and can be used in all future executions of Predict_Week.

4. Dashboard Walkthrough   

Below is an example of the Tableau dashboard generated from Predict_Week.R which visualizes crash predictions by segment of the next week. 

![WA Probability Zoomed Dashboard Low Risk](./resources/ZoomedSegementLowRisk.png)

The dashboard allows the users to filter for crash probabilities on specific roadways, cycle through days and hours of the week, filter for specific roadway types and more. 

## Utility Functions

- `utility/get_packages.R`: This script is sourced in `RandomForest_Train.R` and installs and loads the R packages necessary for using the tool.
- `utility/timezone_adj.R`: This script is sourced in `RandomForest_Train.R` and determines whether the state is in one timezone or multiple time zones. If the state covers multiple time zones, it generates the shape files required.
- `utility/Prep_OSMNetwork.R`:  This script is sourced by `osm_query.R` and pulls the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network for a specified state using the Overpass API. It filters for selected road classes within the state's boundary. The default road classes include `motorway`, `trunk`, `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary`. The script retains the `OSM_ID`, highway class, and `maxspeed` for each OSM link. For OpenStreetMap definitions, visit [OSM Highway Key](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:highway).
- `utility/osm_query.R`: This script connects the road network with crash data. It first sources `Prep_OSMNetwork.R` to provide the roadway network onto which crashes will be mapped. Crash data is then loaded, normalized to a defined coordinate reference system (5070 by default), and joined to the nearest OSM roadway link. Refer to the HSIS data section if you need to incorporate new crash data.
- `utility/Join_Road_Weather.R`: This script joins hourly weather data to the historical road network. It integrates hourly GHCN weather station data, cleans the dataset by removing duplicates, and calculates the mean precipitation, temperature, and maximum snow depth recorded at each hour for every station. The station-hour mapping is then linked to the roadway network by assigning each OSM link to the nearest weather station.
- `utility/OpenStreetMap_pull.R`: This script is sourced in `RandomForest_Train.R` and generates the state's roadway network if required. 
- `utility/prep_hist_crash.R`: This script is sourced in `RandomForest_Train.R` and reads and prepares user-provided historical crash data. Users will likely need to modify the script based on their specific dataset. The script expects crashes to be in the form of shapefiles. Historical crash data requires precise latitude-longitude coordinates and timestamps at a minimum.

The development team is currently building testing functions. For now, the recommended testing is examining the results to ensure they line up with general knowledge of roads and upcoming weather trends. 


# Additional Notes

- `Analysis/RandomForest_Fx.R`: Sourced in `Analysis/RandomForest_Train`. This script defines a the function `do.rf` which is used for training a random forest model, and saving certain model diagnostics.

The [Demos](https://github.com/ITSJPO-TRIMS/R25-IncidentPrediction/tree/main/Demos) folder contains pre-built demonstrations of the results of the analysis, data explorations, visualizations, and performance metrics for the solutions developed for this use case. This will be updated once more work is created with partner organizations. 


## Context on Previous Related Work
This use case builds on 2019 work that the Volpe Center did with Tennessee Highway Patrol under the U.S. DOT [Safety Data Initiative](https://www.transportation.gov/SafetyDataInitiative/Pilots).  The [Tennessee Integrated Traffic Analysis Network](https://www.transportation.gov/office-policy/transportation-policy/sdi-waze-project-summary-documents) (TITAN) crash model was built to be used by the Tennessee Highway Patrol (TN HP) to prioritize patrol locations. The model combined historical data such as fatal crashes and DUI arrests with current data including weather forecasts, and scheduled special events to generate heat maps that identifies areas of high likelihood for crashes. The TITAN model estimates crash propensity in 42 square mile grids. This resolution provides the most accurate estimates of fatal crash propensity in four hour time windows over the upcoming week, based on scheduled special events and weather forecasts. The objective of the TN HP and U.S. DOT SDI partnership was to test if Waze alerts can improve the spatial resolution of the TITAN model, particularly in urban areas. TN HP provided training data from the TITAN model, and the Volpe team quantitatively assessed the value that Waze data adds to the existing TITAN model.

**Associated datasets:**

## Datasets
The internal ROADII team has explored a number of datasets that may suport the development of AI models to improve and generalize traffic incident detection systems. Some of these datasets are real-time and crowd sourced while others are historical and based on measurements of traffic characteristics over time.

### Waze Data
The Waze roadway incident and jams data are provided by the Waze for Cities Program (previously known as the Connected Citizens Program). These data are provided free by Waze to public agencies around the world, partly in exchange for participation in provisioning roadway closure data, and partly as a public service by Waze. Waze provides real-time, anonymous, proprietary incident and slow-down information directly from drivers, aggregate these data, and provides them to public agencies. Public agency partners provide real-time and advance information on construction, crash, and road closure data. 

The data are provided nationally across the US to the USDOT through a Memorandum of Understanding with the USDOT Chief Data Officer. The data have been stored in the USDOT Secure Data Commons (SDC) since spring 2017.
The stream of data from the Waze API is in JSON format, with an API call every 2 minutes. The structure of these data and fields are described in the Waze Traffic Data Specification Document, Version 2.7.1 (Waze_Traffic_Data_Spec.pdf). 

In SDC, these data are housed in a Redshift relational database. There are three main tables that are used in data analysis: alerts, jams, and jam point sequences. 

### HSIS Data
The Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) was developed by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to address the need for a comprehensive, data-driven approach to highway safety. Highway engineers and administrators need to make informed decisions concerning the design and operation of the highway system, considering factors such as the geometric design of the roadway, the selection and placement of roadside hardware, the use of traffic control measures, the size and performance capabilities of the vehicles, and the needs and abilities of the users. To facilitate these decisions, it's important to have data about crashes, roadway geometrics, traffic control devices, traffic volume, and the location of hardware and obstacles on the roadside. This data needs to be in computerized files and easily linked so that it can be rapidly assembled and prepared for analysis.

The HSIS is a roadway-based system that provides quality data on a large number of accident, roadway, and traffic variables. It uses data already being collected by the States for managing the highway system and studying highway safety. HSIS can be used to analyze a wide range of safety problems, from basic "problem identification" issues to modeling efforts that attempt to predict future crashes from roadway characteristics and traffic factors. It is used in support of the FHWA safety research program and provides input for program policy decisions. HSIS is also available to professionals conducting research under the National Cooperative Highway Research Program, universities, and others studying highway safety.

The HSIS data collected by from each state is not standardized, therefore, datacleaning and formatting unique to each must be performed to connect it to the OSM roadnetwork. For these reasons, it is not required that HSIS data be used as the tools crash data.

At minimum, the crash data must have lat-long coordinates for each crash, and a field containing the timestamp of each crash in local time named time_local. It is recommended that when using your own crash data, and chunk of code should be added to the osm_query.R script nested in an if(state = <your state>){ function which does the necessary transformations. 

### OpenStreetMap (OSM) Data
The updated use case will use OSM road segments, rather than grid cells. OSM is nationally available and includes all roads in the U.S. This use case will focus on [OSM's road classification](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/United_States/Road_classification) on motorways (generally aligned to the National Highway System), but will eventually include all highway and arterial roads.
